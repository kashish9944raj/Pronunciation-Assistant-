A bad workman always blames his tools.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
A blessing in disguise.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
A fool and his money are soon parted.
A house divided against itself cannot stand.
A jack of all trades is a master of none.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
A leopard can not change its spots.
A penny for your thoughts.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
A stitch in time saves nine.
A watched pot never boils.
Actions speak louder than words.
All is fair in love and war.
All is well that ends well.
All that glitters is not gold.
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
As you sow, so shall you reap.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Beggars can not be choosers.
Better late than never.
Better safe than sorry.
Better to be safe than sorry.
Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Blood is thicker than water.
Bouncing back from failure builds character.
Brevity is the soul of wit.
Cleanliness is next to godliness.
Do not bite off more than you can chew.
Do not bite the hand that feeds you.
Do not count your chickens before they hatch.
Do not cry over spilled milk.
Do not judge a book by its cover.
Do not put all your eggs in one basket.
Do not put the cart before the horse.
Don’t bite off more than you can chew.
Don’t bite the hand that feeds you.
Don’t count your chickens before they hatch.
Don’t cry over spilled milk.
Don’t judge a book by its cover.
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.
Don’t put the cart before the horse.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Every dog has its day.
Every little bit helps.
Every man has his price.
Every rose has its thorn.
Familiarity breeds contempt.
Fortune favors the bold.
Give credit where credit is due.
God helps those who help themselves.
Good fences make good neighbors.
Good things come to those who wait.
Grass is green and sky is blue, I have so many things to do.
Haste makes waste.
He who laughs last laughs longest.
Honesty is the best policy.
If at first you do not succeed, try, try again.
If it is not broke, do not fix it.
If you can not beat them, join them.
If you can not stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.
If you want something done right, do it yourself.
Ignorance is bliss.
In for a penny, in for a pound.
In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
It is always darkest before the dawn.
It is never too late to learn.
It takes one to know one.
It takes two to tango.
It is better to be safe than sorry.
It is no use crying over spilt milk.
Knowledge is power.
Laughter is the best medicine.
Lend your money and lose your friend.
Let bygones be bygones.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Let the buyer beware.
Life is but a dream.
Life is like a box of chocolates.
Life is not a bed of roses.
Look before you leap.
Make a mountain out of a molehill.
Make hay while the sun shines.
Money can not buy happiness.
Money can not buy love.
Money does not grow on trees.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
No man is an island.
No pain, no gain.
Nothing lasts forever.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Old habits die hard.
One bad apple spoils the bunch.
One good turn deserves another.
One mans meat is another mans poison.
One mans trash is another mans treasure.
Opportunity knocks but once.
Opportunity only knocks once.
Our college’s landmark is our college itself.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
Practice makes perfect.
Practice what you preach.
Prevention is better than cure.
Pride goes before a fall.
Rome was not built in a day.
She sells sea shells by the sea shore.
Slow and steady wins the race.
The best defense is a good offense.
The best things in life are free.
The customer is always right.
The early bird catches the worm.
The exception proves the rule.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
The proof of the pudding is in the eating.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The show must go on.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
The way to a mans heart is through his stomach.
There is no place like home.
There is no smoke without fire.
There is no time like the present.
Time and tide wait for no man.
Time flies when you are having fun.
Time heals all wounds.
Time is money.
Time waits for no man.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
To each his own.
To err is human; to forgive, divine.
To make a long story short.
To make matters worse.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Two heads are better than one.
Two wrongs do not make a right.
Under the weather.
Variety is the spice of life.
Waste not, want not.
We are going to take over the world.
What goes around comes around.
What you see is what you get.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
When it rains, it pours.
When the going gets tough, the tough get going.
Where there is a will, there is a way.
You are what you eat.
You can lead a horse to water, but you can not make it drink.
You can not have your cake and eat it too.
You can not judge a book by its cover.
You can not make an omelette without breaking eggs.
You can not teach an old dog new tricks.
You get what you pay for.
You reap what you sow.
You win some, you lose some.
